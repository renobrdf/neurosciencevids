Hello!
Here are
Some harvard videos from edx class of Neuroscience, for  brain research.

Idea here is to study how to create mechanisms and sensors that can act in some parts of brains to help ppl with A.L.S. to recover their movement, capacity of speaking and other.

With backstackerring arriving some printed 3d sensors and objects can make this happen. 
This is the phase 1 of the research.
